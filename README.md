AccDC Technical Style Guide for jQuery (10/26/2017)
===

The AccDC Technical Style Guide is designed to provide reliable and consistent interaction designs that are accessible to the highest percentage of people possible, and to establish a baseline for Functional Accessibility that can be utilized, built upon, studied, and tested against. 

Functional Accessibility means that each component is fully accessible from the keyboard, with or without a screen reader running. 

Supported by the Royal Society of Arts, AccDC was awarded the "Above and Beyond Accessibility Award" from the United States Department of Labor, and was presented at the Developing with Accessibility Event, hosted by the Federal Communications Commission in Washington DC in 2012.

Included with the AccDC Technical Style Guide, is the fully interactive Coding Arena, where developers and engineering students can gladiatorially hack it out with the cut and thrust of accessible development!

All of the AccDC Technical Style Guide design patterns have been fully tested for maximum accessibility using all of the following combinations:

* Strictly from the keyboard with no mouse and no screen reader running.
* Using NVDA and JAWS 11+> in IE8 with Win XP.
* Using NVDA and JAWS 12+> in IE 11 with Win7.
* Using NVDA and JAWS 14+> in IE 11 with Win8+>.
* Using NVDA and JAWS 12+> in FF with Win XP, Win7, Win8, and Win10.
* Using Voiceover in Safari with iOS on the iPhone/iPad.
* Using Dragon Naturally Speaking in IE11 and FF with Win7, Win8, and Win10 via standard keyboard interaction commands.

The Coding Arena includes all of the following top level categories and implementation types:

Web Chat and Dynamic Message Announcement 
Including: Unobtrusive announcement for screen reader users viewing the same page, aggressive announcement for screen reader users viewing any page or window, DOM node text announcement, string announcement, prototyped string announcement, optionally suppress repeat string announcement, automatic message queuing for rapid message stacking, and programmatic control of the message stack to cancel further announcement.

The AccDC Technical Style Guide also includes important information, including ARIA pitfalls to be aware of, event triggering model differences between screen readers, widget type variations and conceptual differences, current screen reader incompatibilities, and key structural markup instructions.

Understanding AccDC: A Quick Start Guide
-----

It helps to understand precisely what AccDC is and how it works at the most basic level.

The AccDC API is designed to process and normalize code across the three most widely used JavaScript libraries and frameworks, jQuery, Dojo, and MooTools.

To be specific, the AccDC API is an extension for jQuery, Dojo, and MooTools.

The AccDC API module interfaces with each of these libraries and frameworks in order to utilize all of the available rendering, AJAX, event handling, and associated processes, and extends them, so that any relevant command that is processed using the $A namespace, is automatically powered by the core processes within jQuery, Dojo, or MooTools.

An example showing the value of this, is described in the LinkedIn article at
http://lnkd.in/b9VGQxf

This means that, any widget that uses the following AccDC API methods, will automatically normalize equally across jQuery, Dojo, and MooTools, without requiring any coding changes to work correctly.

* $A.getEl // Get the element with the specified ID
* $A.createEl // Create a new element node, plus optional attributes, styling, and content
* $A.getAttr // Get the value of a specified attribute
* $A.setAttr // Set the value of one or more attributes
* $A.remAttr // Remove one or more attributes
* $A.getText // Get the textual content of a container element
(Coding documentation: WhatSock.com > Core API > Misc)

* $A.css // Get or Set the styling properties of one or more elements
* $A.hasClass // Check if an element includes one or more class names
* $A.addClass // Add one or more class names to an element
* $A.remClass // Remove one or more class names from an element
(Coding documentation: WhatSock.com > Core API > CSS)

* $A.bind // Add event handlers for one or more elements
* $A.unbind // Remove event handlers for one or more elements
* $A.trigger // Fire the specified event on an element
(Coding documentation: WhatSock.com > Core API > Events)

* $A.load // Pull markup code from an external resource and load into a container element
* $A.get // Pull code from an external resource and process it
* $A.getJSON // Pull JSON code from an external resource and process it
* $A.getScript // Execute an external JavaScript file
* $A.post // Submit data to a server side script using a POST request
* $A.ajax // Manually configure custom AJAX GET or POST requests
(Coding documentation: WhatSock.com > Core API > AJAX)

* $A.announce // Announce a string or the content of a container element to screen reader users
(Coding documentation: WhatSock.com > Core API > Accessibility)

There are many more AccDC API commands and customizable rendering functionalities documented on the Core API tab at WhatSock.com, but these cover all of the most commonly used public methods.

In order to test and verify this functionality, there are three dedicated TSG GitHub projects, all of which use the same component code for each widget type shared between them, which tie into the AccDC API for automatic normalization.

* Powered by jQuery: https://github.com/accdc/tsg
* Powered by Dojo: https://github.com/accdc/tsg-dojo
* Powered by MooTools: https://github.com/accdc/tsg-mootools

In order to ensure the highest level of accessibility possible for all user types, including non-sighted screen reader users, mobility impaired keyboard only users, voice navigation software users, and low vision screen magnification software users, all of the scalable widgets provided within the TSG archives are programmed specifically to be as accessible as possible using all current standards, with specific adherence to the principles and guidelines documented at:
