        <h3>The Hourglass</h3>
        <p><span>I gazed with rapt attention at</span>
            <br />
            <span>the object borne to me alas </span>
            <br />
            <span>by fortuity or fate...</span>
            <br />
            <span>Boundless bourns, </span>
            <br />
            <span>wherein constraints</span>
            <br />
            <span>of time did not pertain, </span>
            <br />
            <span>becalmed all force of will within</span>
            <br />
            <span>enchantments cast unknown therein </span>
            <br />
            <span>by lands in sandy waves. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span> The souls of all who passed before</span>
            <br />
            <span>the turning of this place of yore </span>
            <br />
            <span>from fertileness to waste,</span>
            <br />
            <span>whispered ever nigh across,</span>
            <br />
            <span>and through the weathered hulks of lost</span>
            <br />
            <span>kingdoms in their wake. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span> One last fortress remained therein</span>
            <br />
            <span>to guard this realm, beset within </span>
            <br />
            <span>by the strifes of ancient folk;</span>
            <br />
            <span>One last bastion yet unchecked </span>
            <br />
            <span>by the turning tides of fate to rest</span>
            <br />
            <span>in lonesome solitude.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span> The storms that swept across these lands</span>
            <br />
            <span>in days of old, where bells foretold</span>
            <br />
            <span>of prophecies to come and pass,</span>
            <br />
            <span>filled the depths of leafless gutters</span>
            <br />
            <span>and empty streets with arid sands.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span> Within the age portending such,</span>
            <br />
            <span>where heedless hearts began to clutch </span>
            <br />
            <span>the tempests yet unwoven,</span>
            <br />
            <span>dwelt miracles in gilded halls...</span>
            <br />
            <span>Dreams in waking, never failing</span>
            <br />
            <span>to leave their charges thus enthralled.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span> These raptures however, in the turning,</span>
            <br />
            <span>could not stand the ever swirling</span>
            <br />
            <span>mists of time, and fearing such,</span>
            <br />
            <span>fled to armored keeps instead;</span>
            <br />
            <span>to be forgotten, one by one,</span>
            <br />
            <span>till all had been undone.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span> Only the whispering sands can now be heard, </span>
            <br />
            <span>whenever stirred</span>
            <br />
            <span>by the restless wind's caress; </span>
            <br />
            <span>As only the rumble of ancient works</span>
            <br />
            <span>can still be felt, disconcerting from nighted halls,</span>
            <br />
            <span>where great machines run on and on</span>
            <br />
            <span>far beneath the earth.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span> Could I divine the ages hence,</span>
            <br />
            <span>and beholding fate, determine whence</span>
            <br />
            <span>that time may come again,</span>
            <br />
            <span>I would comply for peace of mind...</span>
            <br />
            <span>Though galaxies may rise and fall</span>
            <br />
            <span>and twilight may descend.</span>
