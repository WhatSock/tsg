<span>The Hourglass</span>
</div>
<p>
<span>I gazed with rapt attention at</span><br />
<span>the object borne to me alas </span><br />
<span>by fortuity or fate...</span><br />
<span>Boundless  bourns, </span><br />
<span>wherein constraints</span><br />
<span>of time did not pertain, </span><br />
<span>becalmed all force of will within</span><br />
<span>enchantments cast unknown therein </span><br />
<span>by lands in sandy waves. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>    The souls of all who passed before</span><br />
<span>the turning of this place of yore </span><br />
<span>from fertileness to waste,</span><br />
<span>whispered  ever nigh across,</span><br />
<span>and through the weathered hulks of lost</span><br />
<span>kingdoms in their wake. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>     One last fortress remained therein</span><br />
<span>to guard this realm, beset within </span><br />
<span>by the strifes of ancient folk;</span><br />
<span>One last bastion yet unchecked </span><br />
<span>by the turning tides of fate to rest</span><br />
<span>in lonesome solitude.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>     The storms that swept across these lands</span><br />
<span>in days of old, where bells foretold</span><br />
<span>of prophecies to come and pass,</span><br />
<span>filled the depths of leafless gutters</span><br />
<span>and empty streets with arid sands.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>     Within the age portending such,</span><br />
<span>where heedless hearts began to clutch </span><br />
<span>the tempests yet unwoven,</span><br />
<span>dwelt miracles in gilded halls...</span><br />
<span>Dreams in waking, never failing</span><br />
<span>to leave their charges thus enthralled.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>     These raptures however, in the turning,</span><br />
<span>could not stand the ever swirling</span><br />
<span>mists of time, and fearing such,</span><br />
<span>fled to armored keeps instead;</span><br />
<span>to be forgotten, one by one,</span><br />
<span>till all had been undone.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>     Only the whispering sands can now be heard, </span><br />
<span>whenever stirred</span><br />
<span>by the restless wind's caress; </span><br />
<span>As only the rumble of ancient works</span><br />
<span>can still be felt, disconcerting from nighted halls,</span><br />
<span>where great machines run on and on</span><br />
<span>far beneath the earth.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>     Could I divine the ages hence,</span><br />
<span>and beholding fate, determine whence</span><br />
<span>that time may come again,</span><br />
<span>I would comply for peace of mind...</span><br />
<span>Though galaxies may rise and fall</span><br />
<span>and twilight may descend.</span>
