<!-- Important

When Implementing a Close link or button, the className must match the "closeClassName" property within the script declaration.
(If not explicitly set, the default value "popupClose" is configured within the module script file, and should be used for all Close links or buttons)
Doing so will automatically bind the close methods with this element, and set keyboard focus properly when the AccDC Object is closed.

HAMLET
<br />
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
<br />
POLONIUS 
<br />
By th' mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
<br />
HAMLET 
<br />
Methinks it is like a weasel.
<br />
POLONIUS 
<br />
It is backed like a weasel.
<br />
HAMLET 
<br />
Or like a whale.
<br />
POLONIUS 
<br />
Very like a whale.
