<!-- For all container elements that support innerHTML, the following attributes and rules are required to ensure accessibility for the widest range of screen readers:
1. role="button" : Specifies an ARIA Button control. (Must only be present on the active element, and nowhere else.)
2. Inner Text : Specifies a textual label for screen reader users. This may be visible or positioned using offscreenText. (Must not be hidden using display:none or visibility:hidden) offscreenText is required to ensure the same level of accessibility for iOS devices using Voiceover.
3. No Embedded Active Elements : Don't embed any other active elements, including mouse clickable images, links, or anything else that needs to be activated separately. The only actionable element should be the element with role="button".

To add a tooltip for sighted mouse users, use the Title attribute. This must match the text contained within the innerText label.

To add a tooltip for sighted mouse users, use the Title attribute. This must match the text contained within the innerText label.

As you can see from the rendered page, it doesn't matter what the element is styled as, screen readers still identify this as a Link, even though it may look like a button visually.

The data-href attribute has been added to show how additional values can be added using HTML5.

<!-- For IMG tags, the following attributes are required to ensure accessibility for the widest range of screen readers:
1. role="link" : Specifies an ARIA Link control. (Must only be present on the active element, and nowhere else.)
2. aria-label : Specifies a textual label for screen reader users. (The Alt alone won't work for this purpose)
3. alt="" : Hides the image from screen reader users when no tooltip is desired for mouse users.

To add a tooltip for sighted mouse users, use both the Alt and Title attributes. The text for both must match the text contained within the aria-label attribute, so that all three are the same.

The data-href attribute has been added to show how additional values can be added using HTML5.
