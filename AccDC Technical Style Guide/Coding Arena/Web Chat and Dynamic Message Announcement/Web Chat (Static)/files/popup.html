    <!-- Important
        When Implementing a Close link or button, the className must match the "closeClassName" property within the script declaration.
        (If not explicitly set, the default value "popupClose" is configured within the module script file, and should be used for all Close links or buttons)
        Doing so will automatically bind the close methods with this element, and set keyboard focus properly when the AccDC Object is closed.

        <h3>Chatting with Blurt</h3>
        <p class="close">

        <!-- Important
            The message field is constructed using a Textarea element.
            This is important, because when using a screen reader like JAWS, pressing Enter to submit a new message won't automatically exit Forms Mode,
            but will, instead, simply pass the keystroke through to the field for processing.
            In contrast, if an Input field is used, Forms Mode will automatically be exited when the Enter key is pressed.
            Also, notice that role="application" is used on the surrounding Div.
            This is to force JAWS 14 and NVDA into Forms Mode when the field receives focus.
