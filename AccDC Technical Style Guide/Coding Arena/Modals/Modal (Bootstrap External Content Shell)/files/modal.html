    <!-- Important

To ensure proper keyboard focus scycling within the modal when using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, the following HTML5 attributes must be added to the first and last focusable active elements within the modal.

data-first="true" : Must be added to the first focusable active element within the modal.
data-last="true" : Must be added to the last focusable active element within the modal.

Also, when Implementing a Close link or button, the className must match the "closeClassName" property within the script declaration.
(If not explicitly set, the default value "lbClose" is configured within the module script file, and should be used for all Close links or buttons)
Doing so will automatically bind the close methods with this element, and set keyboard focus properly when the AccDC Object is closed.
